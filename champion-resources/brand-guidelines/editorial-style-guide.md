## Writing Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **Spread the vision and mission**: Your writing should play a crucial role in raising awareness about Onboard's vision and guiding people toward it.

2. **Be concise**: Keep it simple. Avoid technical jargon unless absolutely necessary. If you must use it, explain it clearly with relatable examples.

3. **Be direct**: Focus on specific examples rather than general concepts. Highlight real-world applications and achievements possible with Onboard.

4. **Recognize Dreamers**: Regularly spotlight the projects, individuals, and communities leveraging Onboard, celebrating their contributions.

5. **Be a bridge**: Don't assume the reader is familiar with crypto concepts. Use analogies to connect familiar tools and platforms with the future Onboard is building.

### Tone of Voice

- Delightful, Clear, Confident, with some humor
- Inspirational and empowering
- Conversational and human
- Progressive and future-thinking
- Optimistic but realistic

### Writing About Onboard

- Onboard is one word spelled with a capital O. Never write it as 'OnBoard' or 'On Board'.
- Speak with accessible language, confidence, and excitement.
- Don't use terms like Onboarders/Onboardees or phrases like "Happy Onboarding!"
- In the Onboard universe, our members are our Crew - builders and creators, not just passengers.
- Always refer to our audience as "they," never "it."
- Celebrate diversity and be prepared to accommodate different perspectives.

### Writing for Social Media

- **Instagram**: Create a pleasant feeling around our brand with visually exciting posts. Consider local cultural context for regional content.
- **Twitter**: Maintain professionalism, especially when responding to customers. Use trendy language only if it aligns with our brand core.
- **LinkedIn**: Tailor content to a professional audience without losing the Onboard brand essence. Educate without patronizing.

## Grammar and Mechanics

1. **Write Positively**: Use positive language rather than negative. Look out for words like "can't" and "don't".
   - Example: ✅ "To get paid, get onboard." ❌ "You can't get paid if you don't download the app."

2. **Use Active Voice**: The subject of the sentence should do the action. Avoid passive voice.
   - Example: ✅ "Sandra downloaded the app." ❌ "The app was downloaded by Sandra."

3. **Be Concise**: Avoid redundancies. When in doubt, opt for two shorter sentences over one longer one.

4. **Use Inclusive Language**: Ensure your writing is accessible and respectful to all readers.

## What to Avoid

- **Technical Jargon**: Steer clear of excessive technical jargon or corporate terminology that could alienate your audience.
- **False or Misleading Information**: Verify that all information provided is accurate and truthful.
- **Unapproved Partnerships**: Do not mention any "partnership" or "collaboration" unless explicitly approved by the Onboard Core Contributors.
- **Negative Comparisons**: Avoid putting down other projects or competitors.
- **Offensive Language**: Refrain from using offensive or explicit language in any form of communication.
- **Overusing Emojis**: Use emojis sparingly, if at all.
