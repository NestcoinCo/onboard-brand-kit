# üë®‚Äçüîßüßë‚Äçüîß Build for daysssss

If 24 hours feels too short to bring your ambitious onchain idea to life, organize extended build sessions with your fellow dreamers. You can receive funding from the Onboard treasury to help make it happen.

## Buildathon Guidelines

* **Participants:** Session participants should be community members of the city-chapter or individuals interested in joining, provided they meet the following criteria:
   * ***Onchain Builders/Creators***: Individuals who have developed apps or experiences in the web3/onchain space.
   * ***Online Builders/Creators***: Those who have shipped digital products or created online experiences in web2.
   * ***Onchain Freshers***: New learners who have completed certified courses and are on the path to becoming onchain builders.
* **Duration:** Sprints should ideally last for anytime between 2-days and 2-weeks.
* **Funding:** Champions will be supported with $500 from the Onboard Treasury.
* **Judging:** Champions need to clearly spell out the bounty prizes, winning criteria, and judges for the sprints before the sprints commence, so there is equity & fairness.
* **Style:** Sprints should be conducted virtually among City Club dreamers, or potential dreamers.
* **Have a Boardpass:** Attendees need a boardpass from the Onboard app to gain access and participate in this sprint.
* **Proof of Work:** Share a recap of dreamers' experience on Twitter and Farcaster, so other city chapters can relive your experiences too!
* **Size:** As many dreamers & potential dreamers are interested.
* **Be Welcoming**: Invite individuals interested in Onboard and Onchain Dreamers. As a host, guide them by introducing them to our community channels and regular building activities. Champions play a key role in connecting dreamers to the Onboard ecosystem and community activities.
* **Staying Connected**: Add new attendees to the Onboard City Club Telegram group. This helps keep them connected to the Onboard ecosystem and builds on the ideas / talks from the meetup.
* **Branded Merchandise**: If you'd like to offer branded merchandise like T-shirts, stickers, or bags, sync with the Onboard Global team to get these items for attendees.
