# Onchain Dreamers is going physical!

URL > IRL! Onboard is taking the Onchain Dreamers initiative one step further by empowering City Champions with the necessary resources to organise IRL meetups in their respective cities.

## ðŸš¦ Meetup guidelines

Creativity should always be encouraged and allowed to flourish. To ensure that every dreamer gets the most out of these meetups, Champions should keep the following guidelines in mind:

* **Attendees:** Invited attendees have to be members of the OD community - Dreamers - or be interested in joining the community. They also have to fit into one of the following categories:
   * ***Onchain Builders/Creators***: Individuals who have developed apps or experiences in the web3/onchain space.
   * ***Online Builders/Creators***: Those who have shipped digital products or created online experiences in web2.
   * ***Onchain Freshers***: New learners who have completed certified courses and are on the path to becoming onchain builders.
* **Boardpass Requirement:** Attendees need a boardpass from the Onboard app to gain access and participate in these meetups.
* **Quality over Quantity:** Focus on ensuring that every dreamer gains value from the meetups, rather than aiming to include every single person on the planet.
* **Target:** Meetups should ideally consist of **10 -12** dreamers or potential dreamers.
* **Meetup Format**: Host community dinners, coffee meet-ups, experiences. If your event (a) brings people together and (b) introduces newcomers to the onchain world, we'd love for you to apply.
* **Be Welcoming**: Invite individuals interested in Onboard and Onchain Dreamers. As a host, guide them by introducing them to our community channels and regular building activities. Champions play a key role in connecting dreamers to the Onboard ecosystem and community activities.
* **Refreshments**: Plan for meals like breakfast, brunch, or lunch and create a setting where people can easily interact. Choose options that encourage conversation, and are moderately priced. Most of the meetup fund should be funnelled into this.
* **Supportive atmosphere:** Champions need to make sure every dreamer is as comfortable and supported as possible. Unique challenges faced whilst building, marketing / distribution unlocks, etc. are examples of the kind of discussions that should be had.
* **Branded Merchandise**: If you'd like to offer branded merchandise like T-shirts, stickers, or bags, sync with the Onboard Global team to get these items for attendees.
* **Staying Connected**: Add new attendees to the Onboard City Club Telegram group. This helps keep them connected to the Onboard ecosystem and builds on the ideas / talks from the meetup.
* **Proof of Work:** Share a recap of the community experience on Twitter and Farcaster, so other city chapters can relive your experiences too!
* **Be periodic:** Meetups should be organised, at least, once a month.
