# ü§ù Collab with Protocols & Hack

The vision of Onboard and Onchain Dreamers is to enable anyone, anywhere, to come onchain and live a radically better life, irrespective of protocols or blockchains. Champions are encouraged to work with willing protocols to achieve that vision for Dreamers.

## Sponsored Build Session Guidelines

* **Participants:** Session participants should be community members of the city-chapter or individuals interested in joining, provided they meet the following criteria:
   * ***Onchain Builders/Creators***: Individuals who have developed apps or experiences in the web3/onchain space.
   * ***Online Builders/Creators***: Those who have shipped digital products or created online experiences in web2.
   * ***Onchain Freshers***: New learners who have completed certified courses and are on the path to becoming onchain builders.
* **Style:** The session could be conducted virtually or IRL, subject to the consensus between the sponsoring protocol(s) and participating city club.
* **Funding:** The sponsoring protocol will be 100% responsible for the funds needed.
* **Have a Boardpass:** Attendees need a boardpass from the Onboard app to gain access and participate in this session.
* **Duration:** To be determined by mutual agreement between the protocol and the participating city club.
* **Judging:** Winning criteria have to be spelt out unanimously with the sponsoring protocol from the onset.
* **Proof of Work:** Share a recap of dreamers' experience on Twitter and Farcaster, so other city clubs can relive your experiences too!
* **Size:** The number of participants will depend on how many dreamers and potential dreamers the sponsoring protocol can accommodate.
* **Be Welcoming**: Invite individuals interested in Onboard and Onchain Dreamers. As a host, guide them by introducing them to our community channels and regular building activities. Champions play a key role in connecting dreamers to the Onboard ecosystem and community activities.
* **Refreshments**: Plan for meals like breakfast, brunch, or lunch and create a setting where people can easily interact. Choose options that encourage conversation, and are moderately priced. A chunk of the session fund should be funnelled into this.
* **Staying Connected**: Add new participants to the Onboard City Club chapter Telegram group. This helps keep them connected to the Onboard ecosystem and builds on the products from the session.
