# üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª Cook up 24-hour Hacker Jams

**Dreamers over pessimists; Doers over yappers!**

Onboard will provide funds to every city champion to organize city-chapter Build sessions. The aim is to inspire chapter builders and creators to develop valuable onchain experiences.

## ü•∑ Build Session Guidelines

* **Participants:** Session participants should be community members of the city-chapter or individuals interested in joining, provided they meet the following criteria:
   * ***Onchain Builders/Creators***: Individuals who have developed apps or experiences in the web3/onchain space.
   * ***Online Builders/Creators***: Those who have shipped digital products or created online experiences in web2.
   * ***Onchain Freshers***: New learners who have completed certified courses and are on the path to becoming onchain builders.
* **Duration:** Sessions should ideally last for 24 hours max. If you intend to go longer, consider organising a Build sprint instead.
* **Funding:** Champions will be supported with $500 from the Onboard Treasury, and will be further encouraged to seek sponsorships from aligned external protocols / brands.
* **Style:** The sessions should be conducted physically (IRL).
* **Size:** Sessions should consist of no more than **50** dreamers or potential dreamers.
* **Have a Boardpass:** Attendees need a boardpass from the Onboard app to gain access and participate in these meetups.
* **Proof of Work:** Share a recap of the community experience on Twitter and Farcaster, so other city chapters can relive your experiences too!
* **Winning Criteria:** Champions need to have the winning criteria spelt out before commencing the sessions, to assure fairness.
* **Staying Connected**: Add new participants to the Onboard City Club chapter Telegram group. This helps keep them connected to the Onboard ecosystem and builds on the products from the session.
* **Refreshments**: Plan for meals like breakfast, brunch, or lunch and create a setting where people can easily interact. Choose options that encourage conversation, and are moderately priced. A chunk of the session fund should be funnelled into this.
* **Branded Merchandise**: If you'd like to offer branded merchandise like T-shirts, stickers, or bags, sync with the Onboard Global team to get these items for attendees.
* **Be Welcoming**: Invite individuals interested in Onboard and Onchain Dreamers. As a host, guide them by introducing them to our community channels and regular building activities. Champions play a key role in connecting dreamers to the Onboard ecosystem and community activities.
